1. Folder *oep_jobsample*: Sample job used in the manuscript. It does not contain the data in this repo.
2. Folder *wh_data* with the scripts for: (1) Import the EEG data from the raw (.fif) files (wh_extracteegsubj11.m)
                                          (2) Preprocessing and saving the EEG data in its final format for the job test.
                                          (3) Running data import and processing scripts. This is the one that should be run by the users.
